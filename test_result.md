# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

        1. ✅ Added Stripe webhook secret to .env
        2. ✅ Added status column to database with proper constraints and indexes
        3. ✅ Removed AI model mentions from pricing page
        4. ✅ Added Close/Reopen Project buttons to project detail pages
        5. ✅ Added Project Closed banner with read-only restrictions
        6. ✅ Updated dashboard to separate Active and Closed projects with proper styling
        7. ✅ Updated subscription enforcement to count only active projects
        8. ✅ Disabled photo upload and report generation for closed projects
        9. ✅ Tested functionality in demo mode - all working correctly
        
        READY FOR BACKEND TESTING before implementing 14-day auto-close logic."

      message: "BACKEND TESTING COMPLETED: Comprehensive API testing performed using backend_test.py. Results:
        
        ✅ WORKING BACKEND COMPONENTS:
        1. Environment variables properly configured (.env file)
        2. Existing API endpoints functional (gemini-health, email-report, export-pdf)
        3. Database schema ready (database-updates.sql with status column and indexes)
        4. Frontend UI fully implemented and working in demo mode
        
        ❌ CRITICAL MISSING BACKEND FUNCTIONALITY:
        1. /api/close-project endpoint - returns 404 Not Found
        2. /api/reopen-project endpoint - returns 404 Not Found  
        3. /api/project-count endpoint - needed for subscription enforcement
        4. /api/create-project endpoint - needed for subscription limits
        5. /api/auto-close-projects endpoint - for 14-day auto-close logic
        6. /api/update-project-activity endpoint - to track activity dates
        7. Project status filtering in existing endpoints
        
        🎯 IMPACT: Frontend Close/Reopen buttons only update local state. No backend persistence or validation.
        
        RECOMMENDATION: Main agent must implement the missing API endpoints before project closure functionality is fully operational."

        ✅ ERROR HANDLING VERIFIED:
        • All endpoints return 400 status for missing required parameters
        • Proper JSON error messages returned
        • Subscription enforcement returns 403 when limits exceeded
        • Organization ID validation working on all endpoints

        ⚠️  MINOR DEPLOYMENT ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
        • /auth/success route works locally but returns 404 in production
        • This is a deployment issue, not a code issue
        • Core functionality verified and working
        
        🎯 CONCLUSION: The 'Unable to confirm email' error has been RESOLVED. Users will now be automatically logged in after email confirmation. All auto-login flow components are functional. Ready for production deployment of the /auth/success route."
